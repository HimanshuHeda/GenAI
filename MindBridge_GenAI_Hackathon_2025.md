## 🔍 Problem Statement

### The Mental Health Crisis in Indian Youth (2025)

Mental health stigma among Indian youth has reached critical levels, with:

- **78% of Indian college students** report experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety
- **Only 13%** actively seek professional mental health support
- **45% fear family disappointment** if they reveal mental health struggles
- **60% lack access** to culturally sensitive mental health resources

### Key Barriers Identified:

1. **Cultural Stigma**: Mental health is still considered a "weakness" in many Indian families
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Fear of personal data being exposed or misused
3. **Lack of Cultural Context**: Western-centric mental health approaches don't resonate
4. **Economic Barriers**: Premium mental health services are unaffordable
5. **Trust Deficit**: Skepticism about digital mental health platforms

## 🔐 Innovation Spotlight: Zero-Knowledge Privacy

### The Challenge
Traditional mental health apps require users to trust platforms with highly sensitive data, creating barriers to adoption in privacy-conscious markets like India.

### Our Innovation: ZK-Wellness Proofs
Users can prove wellness achievements without revealing underlying data:

```typescript
// Example ZK Proof Circuit
circuit WellnessProof {
    private signal mentalHealthScore;
    private signal sessionCount;
    private signal consistencyDays;
    
    public signal isWellnessAchieved;
    
    component threshold = GreaterThan(10);
    threshold.in[0] <== mentalHealthScore * sessionCount;
    threshold.in[1] <== 100;
    
    isWellnessAchieved <== threshold.out;
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **Employment Verification**: Prove mental wellness for job applications
- **Academic Support**: Demonstrate progress for university counseling credits
- **Insurance Benefits**: Qualify for wellness discounts anonymously
- **Community Credibility**: Build reputation in peer support networks
